"""Shared lifecycle every rendering engine implements, plus the run loop itself.

The loop/timing/frame-budget mechanism is identical across all three engine
tiers on purpose (Lecture 07: the render loop is the general, engine-agnostic
principle; the specific drawing API is not). `run()` is deliberately not
overridable, so subclasses can't accidentally diverge from that shared
contract while filling in engine-specific behaviour.
